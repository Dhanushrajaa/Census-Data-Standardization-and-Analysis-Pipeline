Census Data Standardization and Analysis Pipeline

Introduction

The Census Data Standardization and Analysis Pipeline project aims to clean, process, and analyze census data to ensure its uniformity, accuracy, and accessibility. The project addresses the challenges associated with handling large datasets, including data renaming, managing missing data, standardizing state/UT names, handling the formation of new states, and ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval. This comprehensive approach ensures that census data is reliable and ready for further analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights into demographic trends and socio-economic factors.

Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to develop a pipeline for standardizing and analyzing census data. The tasks involve:

1. Renaming Columns: Adjusting column names for consistency across datasets.
2. Standardizing State/UT Names: Ensuring uniform capitalization and format of state/UT names.
3. Handling New State Formations: Updating data to reflect the creation of new states like Telangana and Ladakh.
4. Processing Missing Data: Identifying and filling missing data points using logical estimations.
5. Storing Data in MongoDB: Saving the processed data in MongoDB for efficient querying and retrieval.
6. Uploading Data to a Relational Database: Transferring data from MongoDB to a relational database with appropriate constraints.
7. Querying and Visualization: Using Streamlit to run queries on the database and visualize the results in an accessible manner.
This systematic approach ensures that the census data is prepared for advanced analysis, making it a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts.

Technologies Used

- Python: For data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- PostgreSQL: For relational database operations and queries.
- MongoDB: For storing processed data in a NoSQL database.
- Streamlit: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards to display query results.
